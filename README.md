# Nightlife Activity

This project was built for the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## [View the demo site here](http://billhefty-nightlife-app.herokuapp.com)

### Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/](http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Heroku.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

1. User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.

2. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.

3. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.

4. User Story: As an authenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
